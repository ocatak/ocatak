## AI Security, Privacy, and Trustworthiness

I am focused on designing security frameworks that enhance the **privacy** and **trustworthiness** of AI-driven systems. This includes:

- **AI Model Robustness**
- **Data Privacy in AI Applications**
- **Trustworthy Machine Learning**
- **Adversarial Machine Learning**
- **Federated Learning Security**

These areas play a crucial role in ensuring the safe deployment of AI systems across various domains, addressing risks in data leakage, manipulation, and misuse.
